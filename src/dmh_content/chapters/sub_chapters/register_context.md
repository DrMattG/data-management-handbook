How to add NetCDF-CF data to thredds
====================================

This section should contain institution specific information about how to add netcdf-cf files to thredds.

How to register your data in the catalog service
================================================

In order to make a dataset findable, a dataset must be registered in a searchable catalog with appropriate metadata. The (meta)data catalog is indexed and exposed through [CSW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalogue_Service_for_the_Web).

The following needs to be done:

1.  Generate an MMD xml file from your NetCDF-CF file (see [Generation of MMD xml file from NetCDF-CF](#local-mmd-xml-generation))

2.  Test your mmd xml metadata file (see [Test the MMD xml file](#test-mmd-file))

3.  Push the MMD xml file to the discovery metadata catalog (see [Push the MMD xml file to the discovery metadata catalog](#push-mmd-file))

Generation of MMD xml file from NetCDF-CF
-----------------------------------------

Clone the [py-mmd-tools](https://github.com/metno/py-mmd-tools.git) repo and make a local installation with eg `pip install .`. This should bring in all needed dependencies (we recommend to use a virtual environment).

Then, generate your mmd xml file as follows:

cd script ./nc2mmd.py -i &lt;your netcdf file&gt; -o &lt;your xml output directory&gt;&lt;/programlisting&gt;

See `./nc2mmd.py --help` for documentation and extra options.

You will find Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations (XSLT) documents in the [MMD](https://github.com/metno/mmd.git) repository. These can be used to translate the metadata documents from MMD to other vocabularies, such as ISO19115:

./bin/convert\_from\_mmd -i &lt;your mmd xml file&gt; -f iso -o &lt;your iso output file name&gt;&lt;/programlisting&gt;

Note that the discovery metadata catalog ingestion tool will take care of translations from MMD, so you donâ€™t need to worry about that unless you have special interest in it.

Test the MMD xml file
---------------------

Install the [dmci app](https://github.com/metno/discovery-metadata-catalog-ingestor), and run the usage example locally. This will return an error message if anything is wrong with your MMD file.

Push the MMD xml file to the discovery metadata catalog
-------------------------------------------------------

For development and verification purposes:

curl --data-binary "@&lt;PATH\_TO\_MMD\_FILE&gt;" https://dmci-\*.s-enda.k8s.met.no/v1/insert&lt;/programlisting&gt;

where `*` should be either dev or staging.

For production (the official catalog):

curl --data-binary "@&lt;PATH\_TO\_MMD\_FILE&gt;" https://dmci.s-enda.k8s.met.no/v1/insert&lt;/programlisting&gt;
