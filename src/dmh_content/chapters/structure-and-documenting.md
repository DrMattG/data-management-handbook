Structuring and Documenting Data for Efficient Discovery and Use
================================================================

Purpose
-------

In order to properly find, understand and use geophysical data, standardised encoding and documentation are required, i.e., [metadata](#metadata).

Both [discovery metadata](#discovery-metadata) and [use metadata](#use-metadata) can be embedded in the files produced for a [dataset](#glossary-dataset) through utilisation of self-explaining file formats. If properly done by the [data producer](#data-producers), publication and preservation of data through services is simplified and can be automated.

Implementation
--------------

An essential prerequisite for structuring and documenting data is the specification of the [dataset(s)](#glossary-dataset), cf. [???](#dataset). The [dataset](#glossary-dataset) is the basic building block of our [data management model](#fair-data-management-model); all the documentation and services described in this [DMH](#dmh) are built on [datasets](#glossary-dataset). The dataset specification is the first step in structuring oneâ€™s data for efficient management, and it is mandatory.
